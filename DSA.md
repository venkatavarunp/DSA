# Data Structures
data structure well as the name implies it's a way of structuring data but in our case, we're talking about computers so we're going to be structuring this data inside of `RAM `.
## RAM (Random Access Memory)
RAM is basically where all our variables are gonna be stored so as we write code and as we use array data structures.

RAM is measured in `bytes` (1 Byte = 8 bits) 

RAM now while RAM can be thought of as a contiguous block of data it also has two components to it of course we're gonna be storing values in our realm but every value is gonna be stored at a distinct location which we call an address.
