# Bucket Sort
Used when the range of values to be sorted is very low
```python
def quickSort(array,start,end):
    array=[2,1,2,0,0,2]
    counts=[0,0,0]
    for i from 0 to arr length:
        counts[n]+=1
    i=0
    for n from o to counts length:
        for j from o to counts[n]:
            array[i]=n
            i+=1
```
It is a `Unstable` sorting algorithm
Sorts array in `O(n)` Time and `O(c)` space complexity
```python
```
