# Sorting
a way to arrange values in ascending order is konwn as Sorting.

Sorting is od two types
- **Stable** (Preserves original relative order when two numbers are of same value)
- **Unstable** (Might not guarantee the original relative order)

Example: Let us assume an array

` 7 1st 3 7 2nd `

An stable algorithm will sort it as `3 7 1st 7 2nd`

An Unstable might not guarantee the same and may generate `3 7 2nd 7 1st`.
