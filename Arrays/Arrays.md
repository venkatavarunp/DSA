# Arrays
Array is a contiguous block of data we know it's stored the same way in ram it's stored as a contiguous block of data
## Static Arrays
Arrays with fixed length are `Static Arrays`

We just need index of element to read so the read operation takes `O(1)`
| Operation | Big O Time |
|:---| :---|
| Read/Write at i-th Position | O(1) |
| Insert/Deletion End| O(1)|
| Insert/Deletion Middle| O(n)|
