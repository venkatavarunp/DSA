# Problem Statement
For problem click [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
# Testcases
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```
```
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
```
```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```
we use two sum technique 
- 1st we sort the array 
- we use two sum technique 

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        res,n=[],len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i]>0:
                break
            if i>0 and nums[i]==nums[i-1]:
                continue
            l,r=i+1,n-1
            while l < r:
                if nums[l] + nums[r] < 0 - nums[i]:
                    l += 1
                elif nums[l] + nums[r] > 0 - nums[i]:
                    r -= 1
                else:

                    # After a triplet is appended, we try our best to incease the numeric value of its first element or that of its second.
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]]) 

                    # The other pairs and the one we were just looking at are either duplicates or smaller than the target.
                    l += 1 

                    #  The other pairs are either duplicates or greater than the target.
                    r -= 1 

                    # We must move on if there is less than or equal to one integer in between the two nums.
                    while nums[l] == nums[l - 1] and l < r:

                        # The pairs are either duplicates or smaller than the target.
                        l += 1 
        return res
