# Problem Statement
For problem click [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

# Testcases
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```
we use two pointer technique
- we move the pointer with min value as there is no point of moving the max height pointer

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        res = 0
        h = max(height)

        while l < r:
            res = max(res, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l))
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            elif height[r] <= height[l]:
                r -= 1
            
            if (r-l) * h <= res:
                break 
        return res
```
