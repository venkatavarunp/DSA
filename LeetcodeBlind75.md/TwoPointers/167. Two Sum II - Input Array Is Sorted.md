# Problem Statement
For problem click [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
# Testcases
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```
```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```
```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```
we can use two pointers technique to find the target value
- we move left pointer if the sum of pointers values is less than the target as the array is sorted if we need to get to the target by increasing the sum (if we move the right pointer the sum decreases.)
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l,n=0,len(nums)
        r=n-1
        for i in range(n):
            s=nums[l]+nums[r]
            if s>target:
                r-=1
            elif s<target:
                l+=1
            else:
                return [l+1,r+1]
```
