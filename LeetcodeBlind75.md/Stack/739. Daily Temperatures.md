# Problem Statement
For problem click [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
 
# Testcases
```
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```
```
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```
```
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

can be implemented using stack which stores index and values and pops the value when the consective temp is found.

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temp: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res=[0]*len(temp)
        stack=[]
        for i,t in enumerate(temp):
            while stack and t>stack[-1][0]:
                stackt,stacki=stack.pop()
                res[stacki]=i-stacki
            stack.append((t,i))
        return res
```
