# Problem Statement

For problem click [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
# Testcases
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell
```
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```
we can use sliding window using left, right pointers where window is created between a left pointer and right pointer we will find the max profit in the window
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        l=maxProfitC=0
        r=1
        for r in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[l]<prices[r]:
                profit=prices[r]-prices[l]
                maxProfitC=max(profit,maxProfitC)
            else:
                l=r
            r+=1
        return maxProfitC
```
we can find local minimum and can calculate the profit for each elements and find the max profit
```python
  class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res, minval = 0, inf
        for price in prices:
            if price < minval: minval = price
            if price - minval > res: res = v - minval
        return res
```
