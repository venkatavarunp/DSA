Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
# Testcases
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```
we can use set to find the whether there are distinct elements in the array and can know that by checking the length of array and set
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        a=set(nums)
        return len(a)!=len(nums)
  ```
