Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
# Testcases
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```
we can use dictionary to store the anagrams and strings are classified as anagramas based on their character counts
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        res=collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            count=[0]*26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c)-ord("a")]+=1
            res[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return res.values()
  ```
