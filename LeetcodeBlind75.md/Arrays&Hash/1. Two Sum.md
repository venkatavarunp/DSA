# Problem Statement
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
# Testcases
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
we can create 
- a hashmap with value and index (as we need index as output)
- we look for the difference with target in hashmap 
- if it is in hashmap we return indexes of current value and difference value
- else add element to the hashmap with index as key
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevMap = {}  # val -> index

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in prevMap:
                return [prevMap[diff], i]
            prevMap[n] = i               
  ```
