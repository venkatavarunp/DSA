# Heaps / Priority Queue
Priority queues can be implemented in two ways using binary heap
- Min Heap 
- Max Heap
Heaps follow two properties
## Structure property
the heap should be a complete binary tree (can have missing elements in last level but shouldn't have missing elements in other levels) and as we add nodes we should add them from left to right
## Order property
Every root node in a sub tree should be less than the all the elements in the sub tree for min heap and vice versa

we represent the binary trees in array

This representation is only possible if the tree is a complete binary tree
```python
```
